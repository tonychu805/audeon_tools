**Feature**: Users can browse by creators to consume blogs/posts (e.g., from LinkedIn, Medium, personal blogs) in audio form focusing on personal and professional growth.

**Description**: A Spotify-like interface allows users to subscribe and browse creators’ “audiobook”, which the app curated (with permission, and managed by creators) to extract text for audio conversion. The MVP includes a manually curated list of 10–20 high-quality audio tracks curated across sectors (e.g., leadership, productivity, wellness) that offer actionable insights for self-improvement. Best to collaborate with creators that are willing to test.

**User Story**: As a user, I want to listen to a Medium article or productivity blog written by my favorite blogger, so I can listen to actionable insights during my commute to become a better leader.

**Success Criteria**: Available audio tracks are successfully listened to for more than 80%.

### 2.2 Text-to-Speech Conversion
**Feature**: Convert blog text to high-quality audio using AI voices or synthesized voices from the creators.

**Description**: Integrates a third-party text-to-speech API (e.g., ElevenLabs or Speechify) to generate natural-sounding audio optimized for clarity and professionalism. Users can select from:
- Manually narrate the content
- Use AI to synthesize his/her voices
- 2–3 voice options (e.g., male, female, neutral tone) designed for articulate delivery of complex, growth-oriented content.

**User Story**: As a user, I want to listen to a blog in a clear, authoritative voice so I can absorb high-level insights to improve my skills or well-being.

**Success Criteria**: 80% of users rate audio quality as “good” or “excellent” in feedback surveys.

### 2.3 Audio Playback Interface
**Feature**: Spotify-like mobile interface for browsing and playing audio content.

**Description**: Includes a home screen with curated creators by different categories (e.g., “Leadership Essentials,” “Productivity Boosters”), a play button for each article, and basic controls (play, pause, skip 15s, adjust speed: 1x, 1.5x, 2x). Supports background playback for seamless listening.

**User Story**: As a user, I want an elegant, intuitive interface to browse and listen to insightful blogs that help me grow, similar to Spotify’s podcast player.

**Success Criteria**: 85% of users complete a listening session without UI-related issues.

### 2.4 User Feedback Collection
**Feature**: In-app feedback form for user insights.

**Description**: A simple form collects ratings (1–5 stars) and comments on audio quality, content relevance to self-improvement, and app usability. Data informs market research and future iterations, focusing on how content helps users become better.

**User Story**: As a user, I want to share feedback on how the app’s content helps me grow so developers can enhance the experience.

**Success Criteria**: Collect feedback from 20% of active users within 3 months.

- **Hosting**: AWS (EC2 for backend, S3 for audio storage) for scalability and cost-efficiency.
- **Integrations**: Web scraping library (e.g., Cheerio) for blog text extraction; RSS feed support for content curation.
- **Analytics**: Basic Firebase Analytics for tracking user sessions and feedback submissions.

## 5. User Flow
1. User opens Audeon and sees a home screen with curated playlists (e.g., “Leadership Essentials,” “Wellness Wisdom”).
2. User selects a curated audio track focused on self-improvement.
3. User plays the audio, adjusts speed, and listens in the background.
4. After listening, user submits feedback on how the content helped them grow.

**Wireframe Example (text description for MVP)**:
- **Home Screen**: List of curated playlists; button to “Add URL”; search bar.
- **Player Screen**: Article title, play/pause button, progress bar, speed controls.
- **Feedback Screen**: 1–5 star rating, text input for comments on content impact.

## 6. Assumptions
- Users prefer audio for nuanced, growth-oriented content due to time constraints (e.g., commuting).
- Text-based creators (e.g., LinkedIn influencers, bloggers) are looking for additional platforms to grow their audience.
- Third-party text-to-speech APIs (e.g., ElevenLabs) are reliable for MVP-scale usage and articulate delivery of complex terms.
- A free tier with limited features will attract early adopters for market research.

## 7. Constraints
- **Budget**: Target development cost under $50,000 for MVP.
- **Timeline**: 3-month development cycle (1 month design, 1.5 months development, 0.5 months testing).
- **Scope**: Limited to public blog curation; no creator dashboard or monetization in MVP.
- **Technical**: Dependent on third-party text-to-speech API reliability and free-tier limits.

## 8. Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Low user adoption due to niche focus on high-level, growth-oriented content.
  - **Mitigation**: Curate high-quality content from influential LinkedIn creators and niche bloggers; promote via professional networks like LinkedIn groups.
- **Risk**: Inconsistent text-to-speech quality for specialized or technical terms.
  - **Mitigation**: Select APIs with strong performance on professional vocabulary; allow user feedback to flag issues.
- **Risk**: Web scraping limitations (e.g., paywalled content).
  - **Mitigation**: Focus on public blogs; partner with creators for direct content submission.

## 9. Market Research Plan
**Objective**: Validate demand for audio-first content that helps users become better in personal and professional contexts and identify preferred content categories.

**Methods**:
- Launch MVP to 1,000 beta testers via TestFlight (iOS), targeting LinkedIn groups, Medium communities, and enthusiast forums (e.g., productivity, wellness).
- Collect feedback via in-app form and surveys (e.g., SurveyMonkey) on content relevance to self-improvement and audio quality.
- Analyze usage data (e.g., session length, popular topics) via Firebase Analytics.

**Metrics**:
- **User retention**: 30% of users return within 7 days.
- **Feedback volume**: 200+ responses in 3 months.
